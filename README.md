# Car-Dealership-Simulator

A car dealership inventory system is simulated using objects, classes, inheritance, collections, file I/O and exception handling.

Functionality includes buying and returning cars, filtering and sorting cars by their attributes and printing sales statistics.

Statistics include annual sales, average sales per month, the total number of cars sold and returned, highest selling salesperson of the year and the highest sales month.

Program Implementations:
January is month 0, December is month 11.

If 1 car is bought, then that same car is returned
this counts as one car purchase towards the sales of the month 
and one car sale for the salesperson.

VIN numbers are generated randomly as an integer between 100 and 499,
transaction ids are generated randomly as an integer between 1 and 99 
as outlined in the assignment write up.
